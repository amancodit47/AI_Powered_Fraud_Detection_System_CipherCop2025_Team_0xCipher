# Spot the Fake: AI-Powered Fraud Detection System
## 2-Minute Video Demo Script

### Opening (0:00 - 0:15)
**[Screen: Dashboard landing page]**

"Welcome to Spot the Fake, an AI-powered fraud detection system that protects users from malicious websites, phishing attacks, and fraudulent mobile applications. Let me walk you through the key components of this comprehensive security platform."

### Dashboard Overview (0:15 - 0:35)
**[Screen: Dashboard with live metrics]**

"We start with the Security Dashboard, which provides real-time monitoring of our fraud detection system. Notice the live updating metrics showing over 24,000 scanned items, with 1,200+ threats detected. The risk score indicator shows current threat levels, and we can see active threats being monitored. The recent threats panel displays real-time detections with detailed risk scores and threat classifications."

### Content Scanner Demo (0:35 - 0:65)
**[Screen: Navigate to Scanner tab]**

"The Content Scanner is where the AI magic happens. Users can analyze suspicious URLs or upload mobile app packages. Let me demonstrate by scanning a suspicious PayPal clone."

**[Action: Type 'paypal-secure-login.net' and click scan]**

"Watch as our AI performs multi-layered analysis - NLP content analysis, visual similarity detection, domain reputation checks, and behavioral pattern recognition. The system identified this as a high-risk phishing attempt with a 95% risk score, explaining exactly why it was flagged: domain spoofing, SSL certificate issues, and suspicious login forms."

### Threat Database (0:65 - 0:85)
**[Screen: Navigate to Threat Database]**

"Our Threat Database maintains a comprehensive catalog of detected fraudulent content. You can search and filter by threat type - phishing, malware, scams, or clones. Each entry shows detailed risk scores, detection timestamps, and the number of user reports. This helps security teams track emerging threats and patterns."

### Analytics & Browser Extension (0:85 - 1:50)
**[Screen: Navigate to Analytics]**

"The Analytics dashboard reveals threat trends and system performance. We track detection accuracy at 94.7%, with less than 1% false positives. The threat trends show increasing phishing attempts, with PayPal, Amazon, and Microsoft being the most targeted brands."

**[Screen: Navigate to Browser Extension]**

"Finally, our Browser Extension provides real-time protection for end users. The extension interface shows live threat blocking statistics and allows users to report suspicious content. When users encounter dangerous sites, they receive immediate warnings with clear recommendations."

### Technical Implementation Highlight (1:50 - 2:00)
**[Screen: Show scan result with detailed analysis]**

"The system combines four AI detection methods: NLP analysis for content patterns, visual similarity for brand impersonation, domain reputation for infrastructure analysis, and behavioral scoring for user interaction patterns. This multi-modal approach ensures comprehensive protection against evolving fraud techniques."
